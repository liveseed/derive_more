# derive_more
Rust derive macros for some common traits for general types.

The traits that can be derived currently are `From` and infix arithmetic traits
(`Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, `Rem`, `BitAnd`, `BitOr`, `BitXor`, `Shl`, `Shr`).

## Installation

Add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
derive_more = "*"
```

And this to the top of your Rust file:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate derive_more;
```

## Explanation of traits
This is a basic explanation of how the traits will be implemented, but the
example code below might do a better job explaining. There are three different
types of traits at the moment, `From`, `Add`-like and `Mul`-like.

### `From`
The `From` trait only works for tuple structs with one element (newtypes) or
enums containing these tuple structs.
The types wrapped by these tuple structs can than simply be converted by using
the `.into()` method.
For enums no from code will be generated for types that occur multiple times
since this would be ambiguous.

### `Add`-like
The first group of arithmetic traits are the `Add`-like traits.
These are the traits that operate on two arguments of the same type, they
include `Add`, `Sub`, `BitAnd`, `BitOr` and `BitXor`.
A simple example would be that one apple plus two apples logically equals
three apples.

These traits work for both structs and enums.
For structs they simply do the respective operation on each pair of fields
separately.
For enums it will generate code that returns a `Result`, as adding different
enum options together will not work.
When adding the same ones together the same approach is done as for structs.
Adding two unit types (e.g. `None`) will result in an error.

### `Mul`-like
The second group of arithmetic traits are the `Mul`-like traits.
These are the traits that can take arguments with different types, normally a
user defined type and a primitive numeric type (e.g `u64`).
These traits include the other types mentioned above, `Mul`, `Div`, `Rem`, `Shl`
and `Shr`.
A simple reason why these are different than the `Add`-like traits is doing
arithmetic on meters, one meter times two would be two meters, but one meter
times one meter would be one square meter.
As this second case clearly requires more knowledge about the types this is not
implemented.

Currently these traits can only be derived for structs.
An extra requirement is that the other argument implements the trait for all
types present in that struct, and it must also define `Copy`.

## Example usage
It can simply be used like this:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate derive_more;

#[derive(From, Add)]
struct MyInt(i32);

#[derive(Add)]
struct NormalStruct{int1: u64, int2: u64}

#[derive(From, Add)]
enum MyIntEnum{
    Int(i32),
    Bool(bool),
    UnsignedOne(u32),
    UnsignedTwo(u32),
    Nothing,
}

#[derive(Mul)]
struct DoubleUInt(u32, u32);

```

With this code and Rust its built in type inference the following can be done
now (this sample also requires some other derives such as `Eq`):

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_enum_val = (MyIntEnum::SmallInt(5) + 6.into()).unwrap();

    if my_enum_val == 5.into() {
        println!("The content of my_enum_val is 5")
    }
    assert_eq!(DoubleUInt(5, 6) * 10, DoubleUInt(50, 60));
}
```

## Generated code

The code that is generated by using these derives actually looks like this:

```rust
struct MyInt(i32);
impl ::std::convert::From<i32> for MyInt {
    fn from(a: i32) -> MyInt { MyInt(a) }
}
impl ::std::ops::Add for MyInt {
    type Output = MyInt;
    fn add(self, rhs: MyInt) -> MyInt {
        MyInt(self.0.add(rhs.0))
    }
}


struct NormalStruct{int1: u64, int2: u64}

impl ::std::ops::Add for NormalStruct {
    type Output = NormalStruct;
    fn add(self, rhs: NormalStruct) -> NormalStruct {
        NormalStruct{int1: self.int1.add(rhs.int1),
                     int2: self.int2.add(rhs.int2),}
    }
}


enum MyIntEnum {
    SmallInt(i32),
    BigInt(i64),
    TwoInts(i32, i32),
    UnsignedOne(u32),
    UnsignedTwo(u32),
    Nothing,
}

impl ::std::convert::From<i32> for MyIntEnum {
    fn from(a: i32) -> MyIntEnum { MyIntEnum::SmallInt(a) }
}

impl ::std::convert::From<i64> for MyIntEnum {
    fn from(a: i64) -> MyIntEnum { MyIntEnum::BigInt(a) }
}

impl ::std::ops::Add for MyIntEnum {
    type Output = Result<MyIntEnum, &'static str>;

    fn add(self, rhs: MyIntEnum) -> Result<MyIntEnum, &'static str> {
        match (self, rhs) {
            (MyIntEnum::SmallInt(__l_0), MyIntEnum::SmallInt(__r_0)) => Ok(MyIntEnum::SmallInt(__l_0.add(__r_0))),
            (MyIntEnum::BigInt(__l_0), MyIntEnum::BigInt(__r_0)) => Ok(MyIntEnum::BigInt(__l_0.add(__r_0))),

            (MyIntEnum::TwoInts(__l_0, __l_1),
             MyIntEnum::TwoInts(__r_0, __r_1)) => Ok(MyIntEnum::TwoInts(__l_0.add(__r_0), __l_1.add(__r_1))),

            (MyIntEnum::UnsignedOne(__l_0), MyIntEnum::UnsignedOne(__r_0)) => Ok(MyIntEnum::UnsignedOne(__l_0.add(__r_0))),
            (MyIntEnum::UnsignedTwo(__l_0), MyIntEnum::UnsignedTwo(__r_0)) => Ok(MyIntEnum::UnsignedTwo(__l_0.add(__r_0))),

            (MyIntEnum::Nothing, MyIntEnum::Nothing) => Err("Cannot add unit types together"),
            _ => Err("Trying to add mismatched enum types"),
        }
    }
}


struct DoubleUInt(u32, u32);

impl <T> ::std::ops::Mul<T> for DoubleUInt where T:
        ::std::ops::Mul<u32, Output = u32> +
        ::std::marker::Copy {

    type Output = DoubleUInt;
    fn mul(self, rhs: T) -> DoubleUInt {
         DoubleUInt(rhs.mul(self.0), rhs.mul(self.1))
    }
}


```
